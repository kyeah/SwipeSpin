SwipeSpin
=======

Note: This project is no longer being updated. It was my first attempt at Android development, and is therefore an abomination of bad Android development practices.

SwipeSpin is an Android application that places a three-dimensional canvas into the palm of your hands. Utilizing a graphics engine built from the ground up in Java, SwipeSpin allows you to instantly draw prisms, spheres, and toruses and transform them in a three-dimensional space.
